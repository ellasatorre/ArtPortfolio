 <h2>Light Box</h2>

<p>
  This project was one of my bigger projects during my time at College of the Sequoias. It is a light box illuminated with LED's controlled with an Arduino. I assembled and coded the LEDs in order to get the desired effect with my light box.
  <br>
  <br>
  I first had to design the different sides of the box, creating a story representive of my own personal growth with swimming. As each side represents my career as a swimmer, in reference to the system of class level from when I first learned how to swim when I was 5 years old. I designed each side in Illustrator, then laser cut into the wood. I then assembled the box gluing all sides together.
  <br>
  <br>
  With the light animation, I wanted it to be like waves and water flowing. More like the waves rocking back and forth in the middle of the ocean, rather than crashing into the shore. I wanted them to go at a moderate pace with the climax being them all lit up with their various RGB values to get a dramatic super bright ending. I wanted the last bit to be like when you reach the top of the wave before you go back down.
